## NOTES

As this is my personal collection of boilerplate, it is (by it's very nature) opinionated. Each of us codes in a slightly different way, and everyone has their own preferred method; while there are many ways to write clean and elegant code, these boilerplate files are the way I currently preferred to structure my code at the time of authorship. That does not mean you're wrong in your approach; in fact, it's highly likely that I've since tweaked my own methods and just haven't updated this repo yet. I hope that you can take what you see here, adapt it to your own style, and then make something completely and incredibly new out of it.

- [Frank Faustino](https://github.com/frankfaustino) - Thanks for paving the way in Lambda School and inspiring both me and future generations of students to reach higher than we would have otherwise. I saw your boilerplate library and thought it was awesome, so here we are.
